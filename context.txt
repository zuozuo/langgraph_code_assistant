Python Classes Documentation:

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects have properties and methods (functions) associated with them. 
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.

Basic class syntax:
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        # constructor method
        pass
    
    def method(self):
        # class method
        pass

Example usage:
my_object = ClassName()
my_object.method()
